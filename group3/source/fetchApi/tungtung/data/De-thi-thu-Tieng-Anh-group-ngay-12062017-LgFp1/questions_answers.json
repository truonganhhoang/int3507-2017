Prior to Hubble, it was visible from traditional telescope on earth, but its details were ascertainable. But now, the evidence of explosion is obvious. The Hubble has also provided a close look at black holes, which are described as comic drains. Gas and dust swirl round the drain and are slowly sucked in by the incredible gravity. It has also looked into an area that looked empty to the naked eye and, within a region the size of grain of sand, located layer upon layer of galaxies, with astronomer who developed a formula that expresses the proportional relationship of distances between clusters of galaxies and the speeds at which they travel.
